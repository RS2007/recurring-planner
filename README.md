# Recurring Planner

For those with recurring plans(pun intended)

## The why?

Why create another calendar app when there are already so many available? How can it be better than established apps like Google Calendar or Cal? Recurring Planner was designed to address a significant issue I encountered while using Google Calendar - the absence of templates. With Recurring Planner, you can create a set of templates to accommodate different days in your life (e.g., University Monday, Quiz Week Weekend, Chill Sunday), all synchronized with your Google Calendar.

## What does it do?

With recurring planner, you can create templates and apply them to the days on which you want to follow them
